Question 1;What is Git,and what problem does it solve in the context of software development?
Git is a version of control system that allows developer to track changes made to their code over time.
It is generally used for source code during software development,the version control system is for tracking changes in computer files.


it solve the problems in software development by;
-it is used to handle small and large project efficiently 
-it used to track changes in the source code
-it enables mutriple developer to work together ona linear development
-it serve as backup for codebases and allows it documentations to function

Question 2;Explain the difference between Git and GitHub
Github is a web based hosting service for Git repositories,it allow developer to store their Git repositories.
Git is a version contorl system used to track changes to a codebase 
Github is used to manage and track these repositories
Git is used to create repositories,track,changes,merge code and more
Github operates over the web 
Git operates locally on a developer machine
Github follow a specific pricing model
Git is an open source platfrom free to use,modify,and distribute



Question 3;Describe the basic workflow for using Git for version control
Git work flow enables developers to make changes directly to the main branch\master branch
THE FOLLOWING ARE THE STEPS USED IN DESCRIBING THE WORK FLOW USING THE GIT VERSION CONTROL;
STEP1;Install Git on your local machine and start up to gitbash
STEP2;Creat a new repository and then initialize by making use of the command "git init"
STEP3.Add file to the repository by making use of the command "git add ."
STEP4;Commit the changes by making use of the command "git commit -m your message"
STEP5;Check the stauts of your repository by makimg use of the command "git status" this to check your changes have been fixed in
STEP6;Creat a branch by making use of the command "git branch"
STEP7;Move the changes into master or main branch
STEP8;You can now push to your remote repository by making use of the command "git push origin branch name"

All these steps are important but anyine can be skipped depending on your repository


Question 4;What is a Git repository?How does it store and manage versions of file
Git repository is a data structure used by VCS to store metadata for set of files and directories 
it contains all the collections of files as well as the history of changes made on the files

a repository store and manage versions of files within a project by enabling developers to track changes and easily revert to the previous version if needed
It stores files depending on their file type,stores files based on their content addressable storage model.



Question 5;What is commit in Git?What information does a commit include?
A Commit include modifications to tracked files the ones that have been added with git. It is a shortcut command that immediately creates a commit with a passed commi messages
"git commit -m "commit message" "



Question 6;Explain the concept of branching in Git.How can branching be useful in collaborative development?
Branching is an important aspect in Git,it allow developer to create mutiple branches and work on them then merge them back to main branch
It is a set of rule that teams follows while wririting,merging and depolying their code using a version control tool.
Branching in Git allows developers to work on separate path of development within a repository
